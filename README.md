# FieldFavorites
## Idea behind the app
The idea behind FieldFavorites is following your favorite football club(s). A user can choose teams from top 5 leagues in Europe. The user is then able to select a team from his favorite list to see some statistics such as next game, current standings and number of goals scored by
a player.
## How to start the app
Clone or fork the repository on your device. When you will open it in android studio the ```local.properties``` file should be created. Add the folowing line to ```local.properties``` file:\
```API_FOOTBALL_KEY="a27c9ee53a65c77e943ded8b337c2d95"```\
Please note that this key is using a free tier on https://www.api-football.com/. Therefore there are only 100 free requests/day. When you exceed this number the app won't work well.
